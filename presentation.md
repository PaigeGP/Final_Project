# Layer 6 - The Presentation Layer

This layer helps make sure that information sent between devices can be understood correctly. When two devices talk to each other, they might use different ways to organize their information. The presentation layer makes sure that the data received can be read by the applications. It also helps to keep the information safe by encrypting and compressing it.
