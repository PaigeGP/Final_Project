# Layer 3 - The Network Layer


This layer manages the transfer of data packets between distinct networks. In cases where devices are in the same network, this layer isn't utilized. Its main function involves dividing the incoming data packets from the transport layer into segments. These segments are then transmitted across different networks based on routing decisions. Once they arrive at the destination device, the network layer reconstructs these segments, ensuring that the data is successfully delivered to the intended receiver.
