# OSI Model - An Introduction 
### By: Paige Pelster

In this tutorial, I will give a simple and straightforward introduction to the OSI model, explaining the functions and roles for each of its layers. This tutorial is designed to provide beginners in technology with an understanding of how networks function in practice.
* Through my current job, I've gained hands-on experience in comprehending the OSI model more thoroughly. My Six Flags position (IS Support Technician) involves tasks like cable replacements, network patching, as well as network testing and troubleshooting.

## But FIRST... What is the OSI Model?
The OSI model, an abbreviation for Open Systems Interconnection, comprises itself of a theoretical stack consisting of seven layers. These layers describe the functions within networks, assisting comprehension of network operations. It was initially created to standardize device communications. It is also crucial to note that while it's not as commonly utilized as the TCP model, understanding its concepts greatly enhances your understanding of networking principles.
