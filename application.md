# Layer 7 - The Application Layer

Layer 7, the topmost layer, is the part of the OSI model that connects most directly with users. It's where the user interacts with applications like web browsers (such as Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and email clients. This layer handles the communication between the user and the applications they use daily, ensuring that the data received is in a format that the user can understand and interact with.
