# Layer 2 - The Data Link Layer

The lowest layer in the OSI model deals with the physical connections between devices, helping them exchange data. It's responsible for sending raw data using tools like switches and cables. This layer manages the transmission of data bits through materials like copper cables, fiber optics, or wireless signals. It specifies things like how strong the signals should be, how fast data moves, the kinds of cables used, and the frequencies they work on.
